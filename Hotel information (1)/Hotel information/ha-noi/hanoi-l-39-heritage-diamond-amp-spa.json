The staff were fabulous, extremely kind, helpful and professional. Our room was a nice size and very tastefully decorated. Bed was huge and very comfortable. There was a good selection at breakfast and again, staff were very friendly and attentive. This hotel is in a great location in the heart of the old quarter and a great place to explore Hanoi from. I wouldn't hesitate to stay there again.",

Once you exit the hotel, you are half a block from the busy streets of Hanoi. The location is super convenient to food, shopping, and tourist sites. The breakfast buffet in the morning has a good selection and great coffee. The hotel staff were all polite, friendly, and always helpful. I connected with Martin before arriving in Hanoi to arrange for hotel pick-up and a Ha Long Bay tour. After arriving at the hotel, I met him and he let me know I could WhatsApp him for any questions. Whenever I had questions, Martin helped me out (even once on his day off since he was the only local person I could WhatsApp). I was traveling alone in Vietnam, and he made me feel like I had a trusted friend in Vietnam. By the end of my hotel stay, I was sad to leave this wonderful hotel and the hotel team members.",

The staff went out of their way to help us with whatever our needs were - taxis, suggestions of places to visit,The location is excellent - in The Old Quarter but on a quiet road between two others that cars do not go down. It's just 1minute to Hoan Kiem Lake (where they close the roads to traffic in the evenings at the weekend and the locals take-over the area for entertainment and activities). It's also just a few blocks away from great places for food and drink. The Breakfast was fantastic too - fruit, hot food, freshly cooked eggs etc. We'll certainly be recommending Lheritage Diamond Hotel to all our friends and family.",

The hotel itself and staff never let me down and thanks to that, I have been able to complete my tasks. - The hotel is located right inside the Old Quarters, within walking distance to Hoan Kiem Lake and the famous food stores, bars, pubs inside the Old Quarters. Staff were far beyond expectation. They paid attention to single details about my needs and kept on offering supports, asked if I had good sleep, if there was anything they could do better - Very clean - Full of amenities - Room is much more spacious compared to similar hotels in that area - I was a solo female traveller and it's definitely safe staying in the hotel - Breakfast was nice, a very good combination of buffet - Western and Vietnamese choices.",

The rooms were really clean and spacious. All our rooms came with a huge bathroom and toilet, with a bathtub in each. The rooftop bar hasn’t opened yet (officially opening on 1st July) but the rooftop infinity pool were the kids’ favourite. The service my family and I have received from them were just amazing. The staff in this hotel were very friendly, attentive and professional. My family and I would like to give a special thanks to Manager and staff for making our stay a memorable one. We will definitely come back again to this amazing hotel.",

The welcoming drinks and snacks is an eye opening to me. During check in, they provided us maps and explained to us how, when and precautions which is a ‘WOW’ in our hearts. The bed is comfortable and the pillows is superb. The rooms ambience and lightning is also ‘wow’ to me. I like bright rooms instead of yellow lights.  I am so happy when I step into the rooms. All the basic necessities provided and the tv channel has the most varieties of all the hotels I have stayed. Wifi is fast and breakfast is good. Their services is beyond my expectations. Appreciate it. If I ever visited Hanoi, your hotel will be our choice and I do recommend to all who wants a comfy bed, clean,",

The first rooms were in the older part of the hotel and very clean and comfortable .Very nice buffet breakfast with excellent coffee. What really gets the extra star for the Allure are the staff - Martin and Sabi at the front desk were extraordinarily helpful (taught us all about Grab) and attentive.

Everything was clean, the bathroom big enough. There is no bathtub or shower tub in the bathroom, but this is frequent and usual in Vietnam. At first it was strange to us because Hanoi was our first stop. Breakfast was dilicious, you choose it from the menu. There is a variety of Vietnamese and European kind of breakfast. Coffee is free all the time.but the best thing about the Friends Inn and Travel is their staff. They were so nice, hospitable, helpful. We really felt great, welcomed and safe.I would definitely recommend this accommodation because you have everything here; it is in the centre, there are nice and clean rooms, great staff and agency as well so you can organize some of your trips.",

I have been stayed in city view room thus it was a bit noisy at night but it was still acceptable if you want to have a view otherwise the backside will be a better choice. The room is clean, nice with full equipment. WiFi is free and fast. Most of the staff is nice especially Mr Martin who checked me in is very friendly and helpful. Happy to be back here again",

The room is generously sized and able to be made ‘romantic’ with petals and such at your request. The breakfast has a range of options and a lovely. The location is only a 2 minute walk from Hoan Kiem Lake and the night market (Friday-Sunday Nights). It’s also very easy to book well-priced day trips/2 days 1 night tours through the hotel. There’s a range of tour options for Halong Bay, we took the Deluxe option and were very happy with it. We also went on the Trang An day tour which turned out to be our favourite day in Vietnam. We will definitely stay here again if we return to Hanoi!",

Right in the middle of the Old Quarter, it's about a minute walk to St. Joseph's Cathedral and a 2 minute walk to the night market and the lake. The room was great. They do have rooms that face the back of the hotel if you want to avoid the noise. Breakfast had a wide selection of both western and Vietnamese options. One definite highlight was the staff - they were all so gracious, helpful and accommodating. A special thank you to Martin . I needed to print something from my laptop for work and they worked hard to figure out how to print from my laptop to their printer. We loved Hanoi and if we ever get to return, we will stay at the Hanoi Lheritage hotel!",

That being said, understand that most of Old Quarter is, well - old. But Hanoi lheritage Diamond did a great job at giving us what we needed: a safe and convenient stay where we can drop our things and explore the city and come back in the evenings for a shower and rest. The value is amazing - it served our purposes and then some (with the daily breakfast so we can fuel up before taking on the hustle and bustle of the city). Most impressive was the staff, who are always polite, friendly, attentive, and helpful.  Definitely more quiet here than the bigger",

We also had a very late flight on our last day in Vietnam, and the staff let us safely store our luggage all day, even letting us use a private room to shower before our long journey.

This was important to making a booking. But there is no storage room, the bag is stored in the reception/lobby.  Although the reception is attended 24hrs this, this doesnt make the guest nervous.  The hotel would really benefit from having a dedicated storage room for guests to leave their bags.\nBreakfast wasn't great, I would book without and get your breakfast locally.\nBed was flush against the entire window, no view at all.\nThe rooms arent soundproofed at all. you could hear the slamming doors and the elevator etc.  but I was'nt street side so you need to decide what is more suitable for your needs.  Although after my travels in Hanoi, i have come to realise noise reduction is not a priority for any of the hotels."

The room I got with view , and I appreciated the quiet of the inside room. There are plenty of food options in the area.

Most mornings I awoke to an intense smell of sewage which generally dissipated when I returned at the end of the day. They were fully booked during our stay so there was no option to upgrade rooms.\nPoor drainage in bathroom, water pooled during shower.\nThe room is small and didn't have enough surface space for 2 medium size suitcases to be flat on the ground.\nI thought I was getting a room with a desk but no, it was a drinks trolly. There was no bench seat at the end if the bed as depicted in the pics.\nSoundproofing was not perfect but it did somewhat dampen the external traffic noise (didnt do much for all the internal noises from the hall).\nBreakfast was on the 9th floor which isn't serviced by lift. You need to walk up a set of winding stairs which may be a challenge for the elderly or mobility impaired."

Olía a humo de tabaco y el tamaño de la habitación era más pequeño que una suite de verdad. El espejo del baño tenía el borde sucio y parecía descuidado. Por la noche me metí en la bañera hidromasaje del cuarto de baño y, ¡sorpresa!, no funcionaba... La alcachofa de la ducha de la bañera tampoco funcionaba y ni siquiera drenaba el agua. Transmití mi queja en recepción y enseguida subieron conmigo a comprobarlo. El recepcionista consiguió drenar el agua pero tampoco pudo hacer funcionar la bañera. Nos dijeron que se lo dirían al manager al día siguiente (era el día que nos marchábamos). Durante el desayuno el manager se acercó para preguntarme que si podía entrar a comprobarla después de nuestro desayuno, y le dije que sí. Cuando volvimos a la habitación, el manager había entrado en ella sin nuestro permiso antes de que termináramos de desayunar. Allí también estaban dos técnicos intentando identificar la avería y haciendo mucho ruido porque elevaron la bañera. No pudimos usar el WC porque estaban ellos y tuvimos miedo de que nos hubieran robado dinero. Cuando se marchaban, nos dijeron que efectivamente la bañera estaba averiada. Un rato después, llegó el manager y nos dijo que para compensarnos, nos dejaba hacer \"late check-out\" hasta la hora de marcharnos esa tarde. Para nosotros no fue una compensación suficiente porque nos arruinaron nuestra última noche y día de luna de miel. Esperábamos también la devolución del dinero correspondiente, es decir, que nos cobraran solamente una habitación doble normal. Habíamos pagado más dinero precisamente para disfrutar de la bañera hidromasaje. Para colmo, cuando hicimos el check-out, nos pidieron que esperáramos 5 minutos porque tenían que comprobar nuestra habitación. Me pareció un detalle muy feo porque parecía que desconfiaban de nosotros. En ningún hotel nos sucedió esto."

Very conveniently located in old quarter in the hub of food streets, it is the best choice for travelers. The staff do an exceptional job in making you feel at home. Best part is that they take your reviews seriously and make you feel so wholesome. Breakfast buffet is very impressive as well, special mention to their bakery chef who made the best cakes we ever tasted It was the best decision of my vietnam trip to stay here. Kudos to the entire staff and team at Hanoi Lheitage Hotel!",

There are also various restaurant and cafes that are close to the Lake and Cathedral and are available around. It was a hotel that had a small but very pleasant time.",

They take care of you as a guest at this hotel as she even gave us her number to text her on our status for our safety even though it was her day off( it was our first time in vietnam). I am also extremely grateful to Mr Martin who helped me in a time of need. I had an small accident in vietnam and he personally drove to the pharmacy to get me some medication.

They tend to your every need with huge charm and efficiency and use their initiative to solve issues at speed. Their English is superb. If you want train times, Opera House tickets, restaurant bookings etc. they do it. The breakfasts are superb and the rooms are outstanding with lovely balconies. We would return here any time.

We were greeted very warmly upon arrival and the reception staff were so kind and made it a point to map out and give tips on where to eat and attractions depending on our schedule. It is overall a smaller building so the main hall feels a little bit cramped but did not affect our experience too much. \n\nWe stayed 2 separate nights, 1 night before heading to our ha long bay overnight cruise, 1 night on our return before heading to our next destination. We were able to store our luggage with the front desk so we didn’t have to lug all of it with us. They do seem to keep all the luggages out in the lobby around the front reception desk so if you are storing your luggage would recommend to lock things up. We had no issues with our luggage getting lost or tampered with. \n\nOur first room was small but clean and comfortable enough. The furnishings and decor did seem to be a little worn down however and our shower did not drain too well. We got a different room our second night that was on the “family side” that was much more spacious and shower drain worked well. \n\nBreakfast was included and really loved the chicken pho they served. Selection was on the smaller side but everything was delicious. It was also located on the top floor sun room that was very lovely. Our second night we had an early morning flight and we had to leave before breakfast started so the reception staff offered to pack something for us to go. We didn’t end up taking up the offer but thought it was nice that they had this option.",
                "comment_negative": "Facility was decent overall but some decor items and furnishings in need of an update or refurbishing. Also would prefer to have luggage storage in a more secure location rather than in the lobby but we did not run into any issues."

The staff are very helpful and trying their best to facilitate your stay in the city.  The room I got did not have get sunlight, and all rooms were booked, so I was unable to upgrade. This didn't bother me much, and I appreciated the quiet of the inside room. There are plenty of food options in the area.

And the big shower with its big shower head was indeed helpful for showering a little child, the bed was very comfy, my child has an extra bed in the room but most of the time she was sleeping in our bed, it was big enough for three of us... Thank you for everything! We would definitely come back!!!",

Abbiamo soggiornato 3 volte, in 3 camere differenti. Colazione soddisfacente, prevalentemente asiatica (poche opzioni dolci). Abbiamo usufruito della spa, per un massaggio rilassante (prezzo ottimo e discreta qualità).",

The hotel is great located just near the Hoàn Kiếm Lake and the Old quarter.

Located in one of Hanoi's most eccentric neighbourhoods, the rooms are chic in design and spacious in comfort. Even though the hotel is located on a busy street, the rooms keep the noise out for a comfortable sleep. Martin the manager, easily resolved a booking conflict with such grace that at any other hotel would have made a big deal. They truly cares for their guests with genuine kindness. You will be in very good hands. My sister and I stayed for four nights with one of their packages, which we highly recommend. We plan on going back to Hanoi and will definitely book with them again.",

In a great location on the edge of the old quarter, lots of good food along the street for a quick meal, although full of tourists and at tourist prices.

It is on a short quiet street which is important in the old quarter. New accommodations means that everything works as expected, plumbing, however, is the staff. Exceptionally friendly, courteous and helpful. They anticipate your needs and have a full range of travel services. Left luggage, escorted train terminal trips and even last minute showers are the types of extra services you can expect. I was very impressed at how the staff worked together to ensure my stay was comfortable. I would recommend this hotel to anyone in Hanoi, but especially family travelers.",

Right in the middle of the Old Quarter, it's about a five minute walk to St. Joseph's Cathedral and a 2 minute walk to the night market and the lake. We chose a room with a balcony, and so it faced the street,  And it was great having a balcony to be able to step outside to watch the traffic chaos below. They do have rooms that face the back of the hotel if you want to avoid the noise. Breakfast had a wide selection of both western and Vietnamese options. One definite highlight was the staff - they were all so gracious, helpful and accommodating. A special thank you to Martin. We loved Hanoi and if we ever get to return, we will stay at the Hanoi Lheritage Diamond Hotel.",

Service by the staff was very prompt. Good food preparation by the cooks (though, I would've hoped the heating would be a bit better at the food counter).\nThe reception and tour information desks were very kind and helpful, advising us on many of our trip itineraries.",

He also arranged for a very nice Halong Bay cruise for us - definitively worth booking through the hotel rather than on the web. The hotel offers a pick up/drop off service to/from the airport, which is a very reasonable cost given the long ride. We were upgraded the first night (before leaving for the cruise), I guess it was for our honeymoon. The nights afterwards were as fine as all the rooms are very design, with nice wooden floor, marble bathroom and  shower. The breakfast is excellent. And above all: the service. The staff is so nice and friendly, and it feels genuine. Also the hotel is located perfectly in the old quarters. We would definitively recommend this hotel and stay there again next time.",

The rooms are big and clean with good aircon and breakfast was a good buffet with a view. When we arrived we were greeted by Martin who gave us lots of advice and a map about where to go and how to get there. He was so helpful! She organised tickets for the water puppet show and a day trip to the Ninhbinh. We had to checkout before leaving Hanoi and she stored our luggage for us and allowed us to use the shower in the spa before our overnight train. She was always happy to help and was very friendly. Thank you Grace for making our stay so effortless!",

Staff take interest in knowing your first name and always greet you by your first name, proving they take an interest in you. The front desk can make Grab bookings for you which saves the hassle if you can't speak Vietnamese to a taxi driver. Also Grab you know up front your costs and my word Grab is cheap and convenient in Hanoi.

They arranged a transfer to the hotel from the airport, a trip to Ninh Binh for us, and we’re always super positive and looking to help us out. The area was great, right next to a great Bun Cha place when it’s open, and great for walking around and exploring the craziness that is Hanoi.",

Was told by hotel staff that the car they sent broke down . Manager said they have stopped using that car service after our incident. They waived off the car charges and gave us slight discount to contra the cost that we incurred due to multiple call back to hotel. I will say they try all best to give their best service after.

He made our stay extra-special. He booked our Ha Long Bay trip, scoring us a steep discount on a 5-stay cruise. The rooms were very nice, and have good views from the balcony . Rooms had hot water, strong water pressure, a mini-fridge, and a desk. My family enjoyed staying there since it was in the city, and near the cathedral. Strong wifi for working, and not very noisy. Near good restaurants, and about a 5 minute walk from the lake. I recommend it!",

We felt very shocked and told him that this is the first time we heard it for hotel stay.

Front desk was very friendly and accommodating, and walked through a brochure on local sights and culture. Lots of ‘extras’: at check out, they quickly checked our room to make sure nothing was left behind, had same day laundry service, and gave us a to go breakfast for our 6:00am airport departure. The room was very comfortable. Location was great, close to old quarter and also the pedestrian only area around the lake.",

Such great people working there. Thanks again for all your nice attentions, it is in the details that we recognize greatness ! As we arrived very early from night bus, our room was not ready, but they offered to prepare beds for us in the spa so we could relax ! They were always making sure we were having a good time, always so friendly and thoughtful ! We really loved our time with you, price is important for us as we travel for a long time, but it is absolutely worth it ! Hopefully we will come back again",

Hotel is very clean and well maintained and also in a great location close to everywhere but just slightly off the main streets so it's not noisy at all. it was good enough but I wouldn't write a review for them if it wasn't the service I had. The staff there was absolutely fantastic. You will be happy entering back into the hotel after a trip in Hanoi's humid and hot weather. Warm greeting with smile from the heart, taking care of you, remembering everything you've asked for, helping you with recommended restaurants, area,  etc, keeping everything about you on track.Thank you for making my holiday memorable!",

Breakfast was great and loved the coffee. They even made me a simple breakfast on my departure day as it was too early for the proper mini buffet to operate.",

Mr Martin arranged all our taxis and helped make sure we knew where to to be etc. The rooms are clean and beds comfy and it is a little oasis in the middle of the chaos of Hanoi. We were sad to be leaving but as we had booked to fly to Da Nang it was time to depart. however we departed in real style as the book us an executive taxi to the airport so we left with an even heavier heart. Thank you for such a wonderful welcome to Hanoi.",

The next morning, we had the free breakfast and it was so fresh and delicious. You could have custom pho and omelet's and there were so many vegetarian options for our friend. And we had a staff member come to our table, give us a map and asked what we’d like to see. And not in an intrusive way….just super helpful!  Would absolutely recommend this centrally located hotel to Hanoi visitors and definitely my friends! Again, just the nicest staff and great service.",

Whilst all were incredible, Ms Sabi was outstanding and really made our stay. We enjoyed our stay so much, we booked back in twice more over the course of our trip. We would’ve have booked in again, but they were booked up! So instead we booked in at the sister hotel which we have no doubt will be up to the same standard. Couldn’t ask for more. Thank you to all at Hanoi Lheritage Diamond who made our stay so special!",

Since the hotel location is prime, one can walk leisurely to the Cathedral and also to the Hoan Kiem Lake within 3 minutes. A must stay in Hanoi Old City.",

The stuff is friendly, supportive and at the same time always discreet.\nThe place is close enough to old quarter to walk and distant enough to have your quiet time. The rooms are nice, comfortable and clean. The breakfast is excellent and serve asian and western food. I can recommend it highly as business hotel and for me it worked perfectly as holiday hotel",

It is very difficult for a hotel to keep the service level at a high level over time but this hotel has managed to do that.The staff is very attentive and friendly, rooms are clean and nicely appointed, the location cannot be beat and the food in the restaurant is the best selection and quality in the Old Quarter. The breakfast which is a nice variety of fruits, salads, breads, etc. to start your day in Hanoi. We love seeing our welcoming friends at the Lheritage Diamond and look forward to our next stay.",

They stored some of our luggage while we were gone and that made traveling easier. I can’t say enough about staying at this hotel and the staff. It’s in a great location too.

We have stayed in some fabulous hotels around the world, but very few make you feel as naturally at home as soon as you step into the lobby as you will here. Staff are all outstanding. Rooms are delightfully furnished and beds so comfortable. The hotel is within walking distance of everything in The Old Quarter and the staff will help you with whatever you need.

Staff deliver a seamless experience at check in, opening door when going in and out, departure etc. Really makes you feel looked after. Design is excellent and build quality of rooms very good.  Would also recommend asking for the 'hotel map' - this is nicely designed by the hotel (rather than the free city ones with lots of adverts) and very helpful.",

The Hotel is outstanding but the hospitality of the staff with a special mention to Mr.Jame and the lovely Ms. Sabi ensured that we had the most amazing stay there.\nWe sincerely thank all the above people for making our trip memorable.

Staff were very friendly and sincere. We were greeted by welcome  and were given very detailed recommendation of the city. They upgraded our room for our family to stay at the same floor! We headed off to Halong Bay after a 3 day stay, hotel offered us free luggage storage for lighter travel. When we came back to collect our luggage, we had issues getting transport to our next hotel due to multiple luggage. But staff went all out to help us communicate with the drivers and eventually offered to help us book a 7 seater and communicated with driver for meter fare. Very very amazed by the service!",

Vietnamese hospitality is incredible but this hotel had the very best and we traveled from south to north Vietnam.

He provided us suggestions, gave us feedback on if what we planned was sufficient to fill our time, and gave us recommendations based on what we asked him such as where is the best place to try the Vietnamese egg coffee....The service here is unparalleled, and the location is fantastic.

Sabi in particular went above and beyond in helping us plan our trip, schedule spa visits, reserve cabs, etc. She really made our entire trip easy and enjoyable.",

The whole team’s hospitality was commendable from the start of checking in to saying goodbye. Their personal touches, smiles and sweet gesture tick our happy bucket. Their bed was the most comfortable one throughout our whole trip in Vietnam. The Buffet Breakfast was included and we love that they had some local food for us too. This is a clear winner for us though our stay was short , it was very memorable.  We will be back ! Thank you for making our day so special .",

The pillows and comforter are so fluffy and it feels like you're sleeping on clouds. We only stayed here one night before our cruise to Halong Bay, but the customer service we received was top notch. All staffs were very helpful from the moment we arrived. The breakfast from the hotel was great and had variety. We enjoyed it before we got picked up for our cruise.  The view from the restaurant though is simply amazing and worth the extra expense. If I ever go back to Hanoi, I would definitely stay here again.",

I was welcomed by smiling and kind staff from the young man outside greeting me as I got of my taxi to the nice ladies at the reception desk. This continued throughout my full stay. My room was very nice! Comfortable, quiet, and with high class amenities. I took a bath and the bath oil is just so relaxing.\nI also went to the hotels SPA and I must say my cupping massage was very pleasant, very professional. I enjoyed it so much!\nBreakfast buffet is so delicious. So many dishes to choose from, fresh and I could see the kitchen staff checking on it constantly, and the waiting staff was also very kind and professional. The location is so convenient, right in the heart of Hanoi Old Quarter, walking distance to everywhere you want to walk to. Yes, I had a wonderful stay and it will certainly not be my last one.",

The rooms are very nice, beds comfortable with nice linens and a fully stocked bathroom with nice tub and shower. The breakfast selections were amazing, including a made-to-order station. They allowed us to store our luggage on two occasions which was very helpful. We were welcomed with drinks and cold towels upon arrival. The location is perfect and we couldn’t have asked for more. I highly recommend this hotel!!",

Including her favourite egg coffee ( which is an absolute must) she shared her WhatsApp number in case we needed anything and was on hand to help with a taxi we had prearranged .. sending reg numbers etc to ensure we were ok!\n10/10 would recommend to stay here!",

The welcoming and warm hotel nestles nicely into the busy lively streets with modesty. Having good sized, clean, quiet rooms and lots of little touches that you might expect in a modern thinking boutique hotel, toothbrushes, razors, diverse mini bar etc. With excellent breakfast choice and freshly made crepes to die for the day got off to a fine start every time. Its not a flash place, in fact it benefits in my view from not being pretentious. But, what really made my stay so enjoyable was, like a lot of other reviews have indicated, the warm generosity of the staff. Here I felt very much at home for my 4 nights stay and I'd happily stay there again.....and remember, if you do go, try the crepes",

We took advantage of the spa and treatments were great and very relaxing. Eggs/omelette for breakfast were prepared on request and remaining breakfast buffet was a good selection. Location in the Old Quarter was perfect . We had room 705 at the back of the building which was very quiet. Will would definitely stay here again when next in Hanoi.",

That did not feel great waking up like that.\n\nBreakfast was ok, nothing too special."

The rooms were comfortable, the bedding was very soft and the mattress firm but comfy. The rooms were to a good clean standard and we got bottles of water courtesy of the hotel each morning. The road the hotel is on is quite busy and the air leaks through the windows but this didn’t disturb us too much. We were also able to leave our luggage in the hotel for 3 days whilst we headed over to Sapa which was great! Overall we had a nice stay and would definitely recommend. Thanks!",

Thete were two big windows on two walls and a small openable window in the bathroom. Bath room has glass walls with adjustable drapers.\nNearby activities\nPlenty of shops, restaurants, cultural sites and activities are nearby in the old quarter.\nSafety\nIt was pretty safe and near the main streets. Although it is better for solo travelers to be back before 10 pm.\nWalkability\nIt is on a busy street near the main street (Trang Thi) almost 5 min to reach hoan kiem lake. A Winmart supermarket is at the right side of Trang Thi cross if you need to buy grocery or other stuff.\nFood & drinks\nBreakfast was good and included fruits, juices, susages, and bacon.

Martin was so hospitable and made our stay in Hanoi so special. In fact, they even helped us arrange transportation, hotels in other cities, and a cruise in Halong Bay!

The rooms (albeit on the small side) are well appointed with very comfortable beds. The breakfast buffet had a pretty good choice including local, other Asian & Western/European choices. I will miss having my daily bowl of yummy Beef Pho. I would recommend booking a Hanoi Lheritage Diamond room to get a room on a higher floor. Thanks to all the very helpful staff for a great stay.",

We had an 18 hour layover in Hanoi and this allowed us to maximize our short time here. We got to experience the culture of Vietnam in an incredible way.\nSecond, Hotel manager Mr Martin , he helped coordinate a private car from the airport to the hotel and gave us a full itinerary of places to eat and visit to maximize our short stay. thank you for all that you did for us. I hope to see you again soon.We will definitely be visiting here again in our next trip to Vietnam.",

But what sets this hotel apart is the small gestures of hospitality they gave my family on our visit. They arranged for us to get a better & larger room for our extra companion at a lower cost; They made sure to ask our inputs & comments on the tours we booked via the hotel each day and best of all they made sure to pack us a delicious & nutritious breakfast since we are unable to avail of it due to our early morning flight home. All this gestures might be small in nature but this is what truly matters and sets them apart from other hotels in Hanoi.

The breakfast was delicious, offering a variety of choices each morning. During our Ha Long Bay tour, we left for a night, and upon our return, we were delighted to find that the hotel had upgraded our room in honor of our honeymoon. This thoughtful gesture made our stay even more special. The location in Hanoi's Old Quarter couldn't be better, with easy access to all the attractions. Highly recommend this hotel for an unforgettable stay.",

The staff were great and in return they brought us a bottle of wine but I think the damage was irreplaceable. The bathroom had a bad smell and the ventilation wasn’t enough. The metal in the bathroom were rusty (such us the shower phone, the bin, etc). Also, although the staff were overall great, one particular person even though she was polite and friendly she was very pushy. She was very pushy to make us pay upfront for tours she was pushing to make us buy. we assumed that she wanted us to book in advance because maybe they are getting a commission, so that’s way she was trying to make us buy before because she said that in half hour her shift will be over, but guess what… her shift didn’t over in half hour (we checked it).\n\nOverall it was a good stay, okay breakfast, but not value for money."

The room was extremely clean, excellent central location and the staff were beyond helpful and kind! We were able to book a trip to Ha Long Bay right from their helpful staff at the reception and they arranged drives to and from the airport. After Ha Long Bay they let us keep our bags there for safekeeping even though we were leaving Hanoi that night. Highly recommended!!!",

A huge bed, nice compact bathroom with a walk in shower; everything was clean and well presented. The staff are very nice, and super helpful. The hotel is close to some of these, but I had a 4th floor room, and it was peaceful and quiet. Hotel is well priced for what it has to offer, and I would be more than happy to return.",

The communication with the hotel was flawless before I even arrived in Vietnam, with them reaching out to me about possible tours, helping with a SIM card and arranging a taxi for me from the airport. As I arrived, I started talking with Martin about my travel plans. Within no time Martin had whipped up a whole itinerary for me based on my interests, and I did not even have to ask him to do this. He advice felt honest and genuine, as opposed to some of the places I have stayed where they just tried to get me to book stuff with them. The kind of service you sometimes forget exists. I highly recommend staying here.",

Thanks to the hotel for upgrading us to a bigger room on our last night with them! I had such a big double bed of my own! The breakfast spread was amazing and the staff are friendly.

Its location is perfect for walking around the Old Quarter of Hanoi, being close to Catherad and Hoan Kiem lake. To go further afield choose cyclotrot transport which are readily available or use the Hop on hop off Tour buses which are located nearby. Our welcome was most friendly with the receptionists offering to help with arrangements. ALL staff were charming, helpful and attentive, including the Manager who took time to acknowledge our visit. We strongly recommend this hotel to anyone wishing to stay in Hanoi.",

They will talk to you and see about your plans while in Hanoi. If you plan on visiting Ha Long Bay, Sapa, or Ninh Binh they will try and sell you vacation packages. It's a soft sell not too much pressure. They will start with their highest prices packages and gradually worked their way down. I found the best deals could be had directly travel agents located all over the old quarter. Staff does work hard. They offered to upgrade my room free of charge for my 2nd night even though I declined to use their offers. It's a nice touch.",

They also have a travel agent to help you book day tours to Ha Long Bay and Ninh Binh and such, however we noted the prices at travel agencies down the street were about 20% cheaper. Staff were very friendly and really went above and beyond to ensure you have a pleasant stay. Highly recommend this place!",

They were able to provide a midnight airport transfer for only 22 USD, which was very appreciated as many taxi drivers from the airport will try to scam you. We arrived to a beautiful, spacious room with fresh robes and slippers and an extraordinarily comfortable bed . All of the staff are so friendly and helpful, able to provide recommendations for affordable local gyms and best places to withdraw cash for the lowest fees. My favorite part was definitely the buffet breakfast,there are so many different foods to try (eggs, bacon, salad, cakes, banana bread, cereal/muesli, croissants, banana bread, mini sushi & sandwiches and much more. We love this hotel so much we decided to extend our stay by four more days. Cannot recommend this place enough.",

It's location was also wonderful, being right in centre of the Old Quarter, The staff were also incredibly friendly and helpful when exchanging money and arranging cabs for us to take to the airport. I definitely recommend that you stay at the Hanoi Lheritage Diamond  hotel when you visit Hanoi!",

There is no bar in the hotel, so no drink or snack options as such but it shouldn’t be a huge issue.\nSafe in the room was not fixed to the wall or anything, so literally everyone could take the safe with all valuables with him/her 😃\nVery “creative” approach from reception manager, who ask me to pay for the stay immediately as I stepped in into the lobby even before he explained me the hotel’s facilities etc. After payment he insisted me to cancel my booking in Booking.com as he explain he must to pay the commission fee to Booking.com and “it is not good for his business”. \nAll in all rather OKish stay but will not book it again if I should return to Hanoi."

The hotel itself is lovely and perfectly located in the Old Quarter. It has a relaxing atmosphere that is perfect returning to after a day exploring the chaos of Hanoi!

The breakfast each morning consists of a wide range of options including both Vietnamese and other dishes. The facilities are clean and very new. The Hotel is located off the center and we heard minimal noise from street traffic at night. A short walk to attractions, this hotel made our stay in Hanoi a memorable one.

Great location, quiet room, comfy and real 2 bedroom beds (not 2 singles pushed together), very clean, fantastic staff, good breakfast with a nice view over the city. We got a room upgrade, and that was welcomed! They instantly sorted us out with our onwards travel without being pushy. Highly recommend this hotel!",

They allowed us to check out late at 2pm for free. We left our luggage at the front desk. We went out for dinner and came back to get our luggage and they offered a complimentary private room so we can shower/freshen up before heading to the airport.  Definitely felt like leaving home and family. We will never forget this experience.",

The best part however is the hotel personnel. They are the sweetest. Always smiling and ready to assist you. So if you are planning to go to Hanoi, this hotel is a must.

We left after a few days to continue our travels south but were so happy with our earlier stay that we chose to return for our last two days in Vietnam before flying home.\nJame and Huong at reception went out of their way to assist us after I made a mistake with the booking, helping to organise a different room, a transfer to the airport and even a breakfast to take with us. Very professional staff and a lovely hotel, in a perfect location.",

Clean up seems to miss replacing simple toiletries. They had great pillows in one room, and 2 \"bricks\" in the other. When I asked some, they replied there were no other extras, as it was full. A hotel has no extra pillows at all? It's strange. Overall, a decent experience, but it's inconsistent."

We arrived on a Sunday evening week before Christmas, which was great as the streets were filled with people out and about enjoying the Christmas lights at the church, and the roads around the lake were closed to traffic for people to walk around. The hotel staff spoke perfect English and went out of their way to make sure we were comfortable. We had issues with a leak in our room and they dealt with it immediately and moved us to another (better) room instantly. We also used the taxi service from the airport that was organised by the hotel which was only a little more expensive that what was quoted on Grab.",
                "comment_negative": "The hotel is quite tired, and carpets old. We originally had a triple room on the second floor which was tiny and there wasn’t any space between the beds. There was a window but as it opened up to an alley the room did not receive any natural light. To be fair to the hotel, when booking they did advise us to get a Family Room instead, which is two separate with an a private corridor. I still do not feel there should be 3 beds in a room of that size. The cleaning trolley gets stored in the hallway of the second floor, directly outside the Family Room. This wasn’t an issue but was just unexpected. Please also note that from the second floor you can hear people reception early in the morning. After a huge leak in the ceiling of our bathroom we were moved to a suite at the front of the building on a higher floor which received a lot more light and felt a little more spacious. In both rooms we stayed in we experienced hearing water travelling down the pipes from upper floors through boxing in the walls - this couldn’t be heard if the bathroom doors were shut."

The rooms are spacious, clean and have everything you need. We loved the breakfast, which was a combination of Eastern and Western with lots of fresh fruit. The staff was extremely friendly and helped us organise bus transportation to Cat Ba island even though we asked very last minute.",

With double glazing to all the windows we were never troubled by outside noise. The Front desk Staff are very helpful and friendly. The Room is a nice size with a local view down the small street, which is always interesting. Good Bed, great shower and lots of hot water. Nice TV on the wall opposite the bed.. The Breakfast on the 10th floor . The Breakfast supervisor is exceptional, and really looks after you.. They have everything you could want, Eggs any way, Bacon, Beans, tomatoes.. Good Bread & Pastries, Best Jam in VN, Lots of Asian delights, Noodles, rice, etc. This Hotel will be our First choice next time we visit.. no need to look anywhere else. The Staff are the Stars of this Hotel, so well trained and caring, can't say enough about them. Thanks!",

Also advise to enjoy breakfast and informed when the tour guide was in lobby ready to pick up.

The room was extremely clean, excellent central location and the staff were beyond helpful and kind! We were able to book a trip to Ha Long Bay right from their helpful staff at the reception and they arranged drives to and from the airport. After Ha Long Bay they let us keep our bags there for safekeeping even though we were leaving Hanois that night. The restaurant on top floor as was the free buffet breakfast everyday. We are from Germany and the quality and service far exceeds anything from home. Highly recommended!",

The location of this gem of a hotel allows you to be within walking distance of all this city has to offer, if you don't want to walk plenty of folk will cycle you through the mayhem at terrific rates negotiated by the staff. They will suggest their restaurant for evening dining at their restaurant! The food is awesome. They will also offer room upgrades at really reasonable rates, and they are lovely rooms. And Martin the manager is a most attentive host and she captures the essence of these beautiful people - they just want your stay to be perfect and you leave loving their country. Thank you!!!",

It is also very clean, and the staff is quite friendly and helpful. We had planned to only stay one night, but ended up arriving a day earlier than expected and needing a room. They were able to accommodate us in a room close by the one for the next night and moved our bags for us, which was very helpful. We would definitely stay here again.",

One of the best hotel customer service experiences I’ve ever had- without exaggeration! they helped us to book Ha Long bay and Sapa tours and even let us store our luggage at the hotel while we went. Breakfast epic and was cooked to order. Rooms are big and clean. Location perfect for exploring Hanoi. Would happily return",

I had a great time at buffet breakfast on 10th floor, you could see the different view in Ha Noi. Thanks to Mr Martin he helped me a lot and upgraded my room, because it was my last night at Ha Noi , and my first time got here. It was a wonderful night~ I wish I could stay at Hanoi Lheritage Diamond Hotel one more day.",

They also provided advise for yummy food and booked us transportation to Halong. Food was good at the buffet too. 100% would return",

Plenty of shops and restaurants everywhere around the hotel. Our room was a good size and had a very comfortable bed! Window looked internally at an atrium which didn't bother us, but might if you were expecting a view. Room Included breakfast buffet was good with alot of options including pho. Staff were all very friendly and helpful. We had a great stay.",

We had free breakfast including excellent Vietnamese soup called Pho, fried eggs, various Vietnamese fruits, coffee, tea, mango juice, the staff at the reception and travel desk very helpful. We will certainly stay here next time we visit Hanoi.",

Upon arrival, we were pleasantly surprised to find out that we had been upgraded from a deluxe to an executive room! The staff were incredibly friendly and attentive throughout our stay, making us feel truly valued as guests. What impressed us the most was their flexibility; they accommodated our request to extend our check-out time until 6pm for a small fee, allowing us to make the most of our time in the city. We highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a comfortable stay with top-notch service. We will definitely be back!",

If it’s within your budget, do not hesitate. Highlights included reception staff. They anticipate your every need. Their English is great. Breakfast was plentiful and tasted great. Beds were good and our request for a ‘flatter’ pillow was quickly accommodated. Most importantly, the lake and Catheral is half a block away. Please be sure to get up early at least one day to see what happens on the street and around the lake before 7am. Amazing experience!",

In fact, I cant praise the hotel staff enough, especially at the front desk (both morning and night shift), who were were very friendly, helpful and went out of their way to make sure that we had everything that we needed. Keep up the great work! Oh and the front desk staff also gave great recommendation for our halong bay tour so would also recommend booking thru them instead of using other apps.",

The rooms were spotless, and very comfortable. The daily breakfast had lots of wonderful local Vietnamese options as well as European to order. The professional masseuses at the spa were terrific and the shampoo massage was amazing. I can’t say enough in this review about how delightful this place is. The location was walkable to everything in the old city. I have travelled the world, stayed in many a hotel. This small, intimate boutique hotel, in chaotic, charming Hanoi, is a gem.",

The hotel arranged for our pick up and drop off at the airport , which was seamless for a low additional cost. Our room was extremely spacious, beautiful, clean, with great amenities such as air conditioning and a fridge. We were given free bottles of water every day. The hotel location in the Old Quarter is perfect for exploring the city. The free hotel buffet breakfast was also delicious!!!",

This was only one member of staff who was really pushy but I guess it is his job to try and sell the trips? Finally, upon arrival they asked us to cancel our booking.com booking in exchange for refunding our taxi fee. This is definitely not something I felt comfortable in doing and they asked us 3 times in succession to do it. No means no!"

The location of the hotel is close to the old quarter as well as the uncountable nice cafes in town. As for the room, even though being small but it was surprisingly comfortable. I would definitely recommend this hotel to others having a leisure trip, but a bigger room will be more suitable for those who comes in a big family. Last but not least, Martin and his team were really attentive at all times. They recommended us things to do in town as this was the first time we chose Vietnam to have a short gateway.

The Hanoi Lheritage Diamond was amazing, you could not expect more.. the food variety at breakfast buffet was yummy, we also love the fact that the hotel has two way air conditioning, if you must know Hanoi could be cold in the winter. And the big shower with its big shower head was indeed helpful for showering a little child, the bed was very comfy, my child has an extra bed in the room but most of the time she was sleeping in our bed, it was big enough for three of us... Thank you for everything! We would definitely come back!!!",

They were always friendly and supportive. Breakfast is very complete and tasty and they also have an amazing iced Vietnamese Coffee with which you should start your day ;) Beds are big and comfy, decoration is smart and cozy. We also booked with them the stay and tour in Sapa and a street food tour and cooking class in Hanoi. The experience in Hanoi was amazing. Both street food tour and cooking class were quite a experience and we enjoyed a very local feeling. We strongly recommend a stay in here on your journey through Vietnam.",

The only downside of the room is that there is no blackout curtains & no body lotion provided in the tolietries. Location is good near Cathedral and Lake, with local food stalls & a supermarket around the corner. 5 min walk to Dong Xuan market. Good cafe downstairs. Breakfast is good, you can order from the al la carte menu & also have the buffet. Great service from the reception team especially Lily who is friendly, helped with a spa booking & reminded me on my deposit. Will stay here again if I return to Hanoi.",

It's in the rather glamorous 'French Quarter' area of town - and easy walking distance from most other sights/famous streets in the Old Quarter.\n\nThe staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful. Ms Sabi's personalised recommendations for my visit to Sapa were very much appreciated!\n\nIt was also a more upmarket hotel than other (cheaper) Hanoi hotels we had stayed at - we decided to treat ourselves to a bit of luxury. \n\nAmazing views from the restaurant where breakfast is served!",
                "comment_negative": "The air-conditioning units in the rooms are very noisy. I don't blame the staff, who promptly offered us a different room when we raised the issue (they agreed that the first room had very loud vibrations/buzzing noises which seemed to be coming in through the vents.) \n\nIt must be said though that even in the second room we moved to, the air-conditioning unit was still a bit on the noisy side - I'd never experienced air-conditioning that noisy in other hotels. Something for the hotel to look into - it wasn't a disaster but did spoil the atmosphere a bit (and bothered my partner a little at night).\n\nOther than this, both rooms were a little smaller than we expected - but to be fair we got a great price deal on booking.com for what is otherwise a fairly upscale hotel, so it still felt like decent value."

We also loved the breakfast every morning, great selection of food and all very delicious. Location is perfect. Walking distance to all main attractions and we therefore didn’t spend any money on getting around, as we just walked around the city.\nThe hotel can also organise day trips which we booked and it all went very smoothly. We definitely felt looked after and safe. Thank you very much to all the staff and a special thank you to the Hotel manager that welcomed us and also brought me birthday cake! Thank you!!",

The staff were very knowledgable on restaurants and things to do in and around Hanoi. The hotel is well located on the edge if the old quarter and close to the attractions.

Its location is perfect for walking around the Old Quarter of Hanoi,  and Hoan Kiem lake.

Our welcome was most friendly with the receptionists offering to help with arrangements. ALL staff were charming, helpful and attentive, including the Manager who took time to acknowledge our visit. We strongly recommend this hotel to anyone wishing to stay in Hanoi.",

The best thing however is the amazing service- it is beyond expectations. They are so attentive and helpful and go the extra mile to ensure you have a wonderful stay. We had checked out but left our bags there whilst we went to Halong Bay. On returning even though we were no longer staying at the hotel they gave us drinks and towels and kept our bags until the evening when our transport arrived. The manager was very helpful in giving us ideas of places to go. I would absolutely recommend this hotel.",

Left at 5:30 yesterday and they insisted on giving us a picnic breakfast. Breakfast on the roof terrace is lovely. The front desk booked us into the best restaurant in town at the Metropole and tried to get us into the Opera. Not their fault it was booked out.\nManager very proactive telling us about the luxury sleeper train to Da Nang when he heard we planned to visit Ninh Binh by train for the the day. Great room with city view and excellent service when there was a problem with the TV. Many thanks.",

The deals you can get are terrific BUT what makes this place special is the heart and soul that you get from a staff whose sole mission is to make you happy.  I tell you they will help you with anything you need and then some.  A shout out to Ms Sabi who was my guardian angel when my visa didnt come through and I had to cancel some bookings she made for me. Plus all the good advice she gave. Me in the area. And to mgr mr Martin Do who also worked his magic. But the rest of staff will make you feel like your family.  When I come back to hanoi. I will stay here again",

We had a 06h30 pick up for Ha Long Bay and the staff kindly arranged a pre-packed breakfast for the trip. We were able to make do with vegetarian options. I found that the Hotel was well located and within walking distance to restaurants and the famous night market, Hoan Kiem Lake and Cathedral.",

However the location also means a lot of noise on the weekends as Hanoi parties around the same location and lots of noise when the platforms are dismantled Sunday night into early Monday mornings. Would recommend ear plugs be kept in all front facing rooms and guests be told about it so they can switch rooms to a back facing one especially if you have early morning Monday flights. Overall an excellent hotel.",
